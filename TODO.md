# TODO for Adjusting Map Layout in vets.php

- [x] Move the map widget (.widget) from the sidebar to the main-content area, placing it above the .container (vet cards).
- [x] Update CSS for .main-content to use flex-direction: column; with the map at the top, and below it a flex row containing the sidebar and .container.
- [x] Adjust sidebar width and ensure responsive design (stack vertically on mobile).
- [x] Test the layout in a browser to verify map functionality and responsiveness.
